Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model correctly classify the breed of the dog.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model correctly classify the breed of the rotate image of the dog.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: For non-dog animal (Black Bear), the answer is yes, all three model correctly classify the image.
For the object (smartphone), no, but looking closer at the label, they are correct, just the labeling convention that isn't correct. (smartphone is identified as hand-held computer)


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Alexnet and Resnet equally. All three models have the same performance using the uploaded image test, but alexnet and resnet requires much less time compared to vgg model.

But, if we are using the 40 image datasets, performance wise, vgg have the highest performance, even though it is sacrificing a lot of time to do so.
====================== Final Results ======================
Alexnet Results: 
             pct_match           = 75%
             pct_correct_dogs    = 100%
             pct_correct_notdogs = 100%
             pct_correct_breed   = 80%
             elapsed time        = 3s
Resnet Results: 
             pct_match           = 82.5%
             pct_correct_dogs    = 100%
             pct_correct_notdogs = 90%
             pct_correct_breed   = 90%
             elapsed time        = 5s
Vgg Results: 
             pct_match           = 87.5%
             pct_correct_dogs    = 100%
             pct_correct_notdogs = 100%
             pct_correct_breed   = 93.33%
             elapsed time        = 33s
===========================================================
Best model   : vgg
Fastest model: Alexnet
